	My name is Luke Collins. I am a fourth year maths and computer science student and research assistant at the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/lukecollins" target="_blank">University of Malta</a>, and the cofounder of the mobile app company <a href="https://learnd.mt/" target="_blank">LearnD</a>. I enjoy listening to classical music and playing the piano. I also tutor pure mathematics and computing to A-level students.
